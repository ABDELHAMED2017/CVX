  <h1><tt>CVX</tt> version history</h1>

  <dl>
    <dt>Version 0.80, July 2005:</dt>

    <dd>initial release.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.85, August 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Support for Matlab 6.1 and 6.5; previous versions required
    Matlab 7.0 or later.<br />
    Added precompiled binaries for Solaris.<br />
    Support for scalar quadratic forms (see Section 4.7 of the
    <a href="cvx_usrguide.pdf">user guide</a>).<br />
    Added the <tt>norms</tt> function to facilitate sum-of-norms
    and max-of-norms problems.<br />
    Various bug fixes incorporated.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.86, September 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Fixes for Matlab 6.1 compatability.</dd>

    <dd>Improved support for quadratic forms.</dd>

    <dd>A bug that prevented some Euclidean norm constraints from
    being declared was fixed.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.87/0.87.1, October 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Improved the setup routine (<tt>cvx_setup</tt>).</dd>

    <dd>Updated the documentation with a table of contents and a
    new section explaining the status messages returned by
    <tt>CVX</tt>.</dd>

    <dd>Implemented workarounds for bugs in SeDuMi's handling of
    certain degenerate problems.</dd>

    <dd>Created a MEX file to improve presolve performance.</dd>

    <dd>Miscellaneous bug fixes, performance improvements, and
    documentation updates.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.88, December 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Further improvements to the setup routine
    (<tt>cvx_setup</tt>).</dd>

    <dd>A bug with the potential to cause invalid numerical results
    has been fixed. It is unlikely that this bug has caused anyone
    problems, except for the person who reported it, because: 1) it
    required a unique set of circumstances to exercise it; and 2)
    even if it were exercised, it would likely produce
    <i>obviously</i> invalid results.</dd>

    <dd>Improvements have been made to prevent <tt>OUT OF
    MEMORY</tt> errors for certain large problems.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.89, December 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Official release of the expanded example library.</dd>

    <dd>Added support for indexed dual variables; see the
    documentation for details.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.90, January 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Added support for the geometric mean function
    <tt>geomean</tt> and the determinant function
    <tt>det_root2n</tt>, enabling the solution of determinant
    maximization problems. (Previous versions of <tt>cvx</tt>
    provided the <tt>geomean</tt> function, but it was not
    documented or supported because of its unreliability in
    infeasible problems. This shortcoming has been addressed, so
    now we have made it "official.")</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.91, January 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Added support for the determinant function
    <tt>det_rootn</tt>.</dd>

    <dd>Added a new semidefinite programming mode, which is
    activated with the command <tt>cvx_begin sdp</tt>; see the user
    guide for details.</dd>

    <dd>Miscellaneous bug fixes related to the solution of complex
    norm minimization problems, convex quadratic forms, and a
    workaround for a SeDuMi bug.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.92, February 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Fixes for feasibility problems and large matrix
    multiplications</dd>

    <dd>Added support for the approximate <tt>log(sum(exp()))</tt>
    function <tt>logsumexp_sdp</tt>. This function allows geometric
    programs, already transformed into convex form, to be solved
    without the need for a dedicated solver: that is, SeDuMi (and
    as of version 1.1, SDPT3) will
    solve them! Type <tt>help logsumexp_sdp</tt> from the MATLAB
    command line for details.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.93, March 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Final release of the ``pre-GP'' version of the code.</dd>

    <dt>Version 1.0 beta, March 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Major revision. Much of the internal structure has been
    reworked in order to improve performance and facilitate
    geometric programming support.</dd>

    <dt>Version 1.0 beta 2, April 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Bug fix release.</dd>

    <dt>Version 1.0 beta 3, June 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Bug fix and performance improvement release. This release
    incorporates quite a few fixes reported by students in Stephen
    Boyd's <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee364/">convex
    optimization class</a>. Many thanks to them <i>and</i> to all
    of our faithful users for their testing and reports.</dd>

    <dt>Version 1.0RC, October 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Added support for Matlab R2006b.</dd>

    <dd>Incorporated SeDuMi 1.1R3, and added an additional bug
    fix.</dd>

    <dd>The absolute value function is now represented using a
    second-order cone to better exploit sparsity. This also impacts
    1-norms and infinity-norms.</dd>

    <dd>Added support for <i>p</i>-norms for values of <i>p</i>
    other than 1, 2, and infinity; and added support for
    expressions of the form <tt>x^p</tt> where <tt>p</tt> is a
    positive even integer OR a real integer between 0 and 1. See
    the user guide for a very mild caution on the use of powers and
    <i>p</i>-norms.</dd>

    <dd>New and/or improved functions: <tt>pow_pos(x,p)</tt>,
    <tt>pow_abs(x,p)</tt>, <tt>norm(x,p)</tt>,
    <tt>huber(x,M,t)</tt>, <tt>berhu(x,M,t)</tt>,
    <tt>polyval(p,x)</tt>, <tt>polyenv(p,x)</tt>.</dd>

    <dd>New sets: <tt>nonneg_poly_coeffs(deg)</tt> and
    <tt>convex_poly_coeffs(deg)</tt>.</dd>

    <dt>Version 1.0RC2, February 2007:</dt>

    <dd>A bug has been discovered in SeDuMi that was producing
    incorrect results for some, but not all, problems involving
    second-order cones, norms, powers, and absolute values. A
    temporary workaround has been provided to detect these cases
    and return an invalid result flag, a permanent fix is
    forthcoming.</dd>

    <dt>Version 1.1beta, August 2007:</dt>

    <dd>Support for the solver SDPT3 has been added; in fact, SDPT3
    is now the default solver. This provides support for later
    (&ge;7.3) versions of Matlab for 64-bit platforms. The
    directory structure has been rearranged considerably, and a
    couple of minor bugs have been fixed, but no major
    functionality has been added.</dd>

    <dd>Automatic dualization added. CVX now analyzes problem structure
    to determine if a model is more efficiently solved in dual standard
    form instead of primal standard form; and if so, it sends the dual
    problem to the solver instead. For models with far more inequalities
    than variables, this approach can improve both speed and accuracy.
