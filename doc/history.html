<h2>Version history</h2>
<dl>
<dt>0.80, July 2005:</dt>
<dd>
initial release.</dd>
<dt>0.85, August 2005:</dt>
<dd>
Support for Matlab 6.1 and 6.5; previous versions required Matlab 7.0 or later.<br />
Added precompiled binaries for Solaris.<br />
Support for scalar quadratic forms (see Section 4.7 of the users&rsquo; guide).<br />
Added the <tt>norms</tt> function to facilitate sum-of-norms and max-of-norms problems.<br />
Various bug fixes incorporated.</dd>
<dt>0.86, September 2005:</dt>
<dd>
Fixes for Matlab 6.1 compatability.<br />
Improved support for quadratic forms.<br />
A bug that prevented some Euclidean norm constraints from being declared was fixed.</dd>
<dt>0.87,0.87.1, October 2005:</dt>
<dd>
Improved the setup routine (<tt>cvx_setup</tt>).<br />
Updated the documentation with a table of contents and a 
new section explaining the status messages returned by CVX.<br />
Implemented workarounds for bugs in SeDuMi&rsquo;s handling of certain degenerate problems.<br />
Created a MEX file to improve presolve performance.<br />
Miscellaneous bug fixes, performance improvements, and documentation updates.</dd>
<dt>0.88, December 2005:</dt>
<dd>
Further improvements to the setup routine (<tt>cvx_setup</tt>).<br />
A bug with the potential to cause invalid numerical results
has been fixed. It is unlikely that this bug has caused anyone
problems, except for the person who reported it, because: 1) it
required a unique set of circumstances to exercise it; and 2)
even if it were exercised, it would likely produce
<i>obviously</i> invalid results.<br />
Improvements have been made to prevent <tt>OUT OF
MEMORY</tt> errors for certain large problems.<br /></dd>
<dt>0.89, December 2005:</dt>
<dd>
Official release of the expanded example library.<br />
Added support for indexed dual variables; see the documentation for details.<br /></dd>
<dt>0.90, January 2006:</dt>
<dd>
Added support for the geometric mean function
<tt>geomean</tt> and the determinant function
<tt>det_root2n</tt>, enabling the solution of determinant
maximization problems. (Previous versions of <tt>cvx</tt>
provided the <tt>geomean</tt> function, but it was not
documented or supported because of its unreliability in
infeasible problems. This shortcoming has been addressed, so
now we have made it &ldquo;official.&rdquo;)<br /></dd>
<dt>0.91, January 2006:</dt>
<dd>
Added support for the determinant function <tt>det_rootn</tt>.<br />
Added a new semidefinite programming mode, which is
activated with the command <tt>cvx_begin sdp</tt>; see the user
guide for details.<br />
Miscellaneous bug fixes related to the solution of complex
norm minimization problems, convex quadratic forms, and a
workaround for a SeDuMi bug.</dd>
<dt>0.92, February 2006:</dt>
<dd>
Fixes for feasibility problems and large matrix
multiplications<br />
Added support for the approximate <tt>log(sum(exp()))</tt>
function <tt>logsumexp_sdp</tt>. This function allows geometric
programs, already transformed into convex form, to be solved
without the need for a dedicated solver: that is, SeDuMi (and
as of version 1.1, SDPT3) will
solve them! Type <tt>help logsumexp_sdp</tt> from the MATLAB
command line for details.</dd>
<dt>0.93, March 2006:</dt>
<dd>
Final release of the &lsquo;&lsquo;pre-GP&rsquo;&rsquo; version of the code.</dd>
<dt>1.0 beta, March 2006:</dt>
<dd>
Major revision. Much of the internal structure has been
reworked in order to improve performance and facilitate
geometric programming support.</dd>
<dt>1.0 beta 2, April 2006:</dt>
<dd>
Bug fix release.</dd>
<dt>1.0 beta 3, June 2006:</dt>
<dd>
Bug fix and performance improvement release. This release
incorporates quite a few fixes reported by students in Stephen
Boyd&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee364">convex optimization class</a>.
Many thanks to them <i>and</i> to all
of our faithful users for their testing and reports.</dd>
<dt>1.0RC, October 2006:</dt>
<dd>
Added support for Matlab R2006b.<br />
Incorporated SeDuMi 1.1R3, and added an additional bug fix.<br />
The absolute value function is now represented using a
second-order cone to better exploit sparsity. This also impacts
1-norms and infinity-norms.<br />
Added support for <i>p</i>-norms for values of <i>p</i>
other than 1, 2, and infinity; and added support for
expressions of the form <tt>x^p</tt> where <tt>p</tt> is real. See
the user guide for a very mild caution on the use of powers and
<i>p</i>-norms.<br />
New and/or improved functions: <tt>pow_pos(x,p)</tt>,
<tt>pow_abs(x,p)</tt>, <tt>norm(x,p)</tt>,
<tt>huber(x,M,t)</tt>, <tt>berhu(x,M,t)</tt>,
<tt>polyval(p,x)</tt>, <tt>polyenv(p,x)</tt>.<br />New sets: <tt>nonneg_poly_coeffs(deg)</tt> and
<tt>convex_poly_coeffs(deg)</tt>.</dd>
<dt>1.0RC2, February 2007:</dt>
<dd>A bug has been discovered in SeDuMi that was producing
incorrect results for some, but not all, problems involving
second-order cones, norms, powers, and absolute values. A
temporary workaround has been provided to detect these cases
and return an invalid result flag, a permanent fix is
forthcoming.</dd>
<dt>1.1beta, August 2007:</dt>
<dd>
Support for the solver SDPT3 has been added; in fact, SDPT3
is now the default solver. This provides support for later
(&gt;7.3) versions of Matlab for 64-bit platforms. The
directory structure has been rearranged considerably, and a
couple of minor bugs have been fixed, but no major
functionality has been added.<br />Automatic dualization added.<br />
CVX now analyzes problem structure
to determine if a model is more efficiently solved in dual standard
form instead of primal standard form; and if so, it sends the dual
problem to the solver instead. For models with far more inequalities
than variables, this approach can improve both speed and accuracy.<br />Lots of inline help added. Type &ldquo;help&rdquo; and look for the CVX
entries to begin.<br />
Support for the MATLAB built-in function <tt>conv</tt> added.</dd>
