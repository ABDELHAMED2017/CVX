  <h3><a id="intro" name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

  <p><tt>CVX</tt> is a Matlab-based modeling system for convex
  optimization. <tt>CVX</tt> turns Matlab into a modeling language,
  allowing constraints and objectives to be specified using
  standard Matlab expression syntax. For example, the following
  code segment randomly generates a constrained norm minimization
  problem, and solves it:</p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary=
  "CVX code example">
    <tr>
      <td width="15%"></td>

      <td width="85%"><code>m = 20; n = 10; p = 4;<br />
      A = randn(m,n); b = randn(m,1);<br />
      C = randn(p,n); d = randn(p,1);<br />
      cvx_begin<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variable x(n)<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minimize( norm( A * x - b, 2 )
      )<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject to<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C * x ==
      d;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;norm( x, Inf
      ) &lt;= 0.4;<br />
      cvx_end</code></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>In its default mode, <tt>CVX</tt> supports a particular
  approach to convex optimization that we call <a href=
  "http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/disc_cvx_prog.html"><i>disciplined
  convex programming</i></a>. Under this approach, convex functions
  and sets are built up from a small set of rules from convex
  analysis, starting from a base library of convex functions and
  sets. Constraints and objectives that are expressed using these
  rules are automatically transformed to a canonical form and
  solved. For more information on disciplined convex programming,
  see <a href=
  "http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/disc_cvx_prog.html">this
  paper</a>; for the basics of convex analysis and convex
  optimization, see the book <cite><a href=
  "http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook">Convex
  Optimization</a>.</cite></p>

  <p><tt>CVX</tt> also supports <i>geometric programming</i> (GP)
  through the use of a special GP mode. Geometric programs are not
  convex, but can be made so by applying a certain transformation.
  In this mode, <tt>CVX</tt> allows GPs to be constructed in their
  native, nonconvex form, transforms them automatically to a
  solvable convex form, and translates the numerical results back
  to the original problem.</p>

  <p>More information about <tt>CVX</tt> can be found in the
  <cite><a href="cvx_usrguide.pdf"><tt>CVX</tt> Users'
  Guide</a>.</cite></p>

  <h3><a id="examples" name="examples">The example library</a></h3>

  <p>The <tt>CVX</tt> package includes a growing library of
  examples to help get you started. A large number of examples have
  been provided which reproduce figures or examples from the book
  <cite><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook">Convex
  Optimization</a>.</cite> We will continue to add to this library
  over time, particularly as new capabilities are added to
  <tt>CVX</tt>.</p>

  <p>You can browse through this library now&mdash;without having
  to download and install <tt>CVX</tt>&mdash;by <a href=
  "examples/index.html">clicking here</a>. Of course, if you wish
  to run any of the examples, please proceed to the <a href=
  "#down">download section</a> below.</p>

  <h3><a id="system" name="system">System requirements</a></h3>

  <p>The <tt>CVX</tt> modeling system is built using <a href=
  "http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>, and
  requires version 6.1 or later of Matlab to run. It is built using
  both native Matlab code and C MEX files. It currently employs
  <a href="http://sedumi.mcmaster.ca">SeDuMi</a> as its solver,
  which is also built using a combination of Matlab and C MEX
  files. Precompiled binaries for Windows, Linux, and Solaris are
  supplied with the distribution, but it should work fine on other
  platforms as well, as long as they support both Matlab and
  SeDuMi. See Appendix A of the <a href="cvx_usrguide.pdf">user
  guide</a> for more detials, and for installation
  instructions.</p>

  <h3><a id="mail" name="mail">The <tt>CVX</tt> mailing

  <h3><a id="hist" name="hist">Version history</a></h3>

  <p>The first public release of <tt>CVX</tt> was in July of 2005
  with version 0.80 alpha. Between July 2005 and March 2006, a
  number of incremental improvements and bug fixes were made,
  culminating in the release of 0.93 alpha in March 2006.</p>

  <p>Version 1.0 (beta) represents a major revision of the
  software. Much of the system's internals have been reworked in
  order to improve efficiency and performance, and to support the
  addition of geometric programming support.</p>

  <p>For a more detailed version history, <a href=
  "history.html">click here.</a></p>

  <h3><a id="plans" name="plans">Future plans</a></h3>

  <p>The next major revision will add support for smooth
  nonlinearities. The current plan is to include <tt>log()</tt>,
  <tt>exp()</tt>, <tt>entropy()</tt>, and convex and concave
  branches of <tt>pow(x,p)</tt>. Others may be added upon request.
  This revision will require the development of a new solver,
  however, so its release date cannot be predicted at this
  point.</p>
