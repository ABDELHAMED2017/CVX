  <h3><a id="intro" name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

  <p><tt>CVX</tt> is a Matlab-based modeling system for convex
  optimization. <tt>CVX</tt> turns Matlab into a modeling language,
  allowing constraints and objectives to be specified using
  standard Matlab expression syntax. For example, the following
  code segment randomly generates a constrained norm minimization
  problem, and solves it:</p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary=
  "CVX code example">
    <tr>
      <td width="15%"></td>

      <td width="85%"><code>m = 20; n = 10; p = 4;<br />
      A = randn(m,n); b = randn(m,1);<br />
      C = randn(p,n); d = randn(p,1);<br />
      cvx_begin<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variable x(n)<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minimize( norm( A * x - b, 2 )
      )<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject to<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C * x ==
      d;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;norm( x, Inf
      ) &lt;= 0.4;<br />
      cvx_end</code></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>To be precise, <tt>CVX</tt> supports a particular approach to
  convex optimization that we call <a href=
  "http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/disc_cvx_prog.html"><i>disciplined
  convex programming</i></a>. Under this approach, convex functions
  and sets are built up from a small set of rules from convex
  analysis, starting from a base library of convex functions and
  sets. Constraints and objectives that are expressed using these
  rules are automatically transformed to a canonical form and
  solved. For more information on disciplined convex programming,
  see <a href=
  "http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/disc_cvx_prog.html">this
  paper</a>; for the basics of convex analysis and convex
  optimization, see the book <cite><a href=
  "http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook">Convex
  Optimization</a>.</cite></p>

  <p>This version of <tt>CVX</tt> relies on <a href=
  "http://sedumi.mcmaster.ca/">SeDuMi</a> as the core solver, and
  so is restricted in the functions, sets, and problems it can
  handle. Still, it can handle a wide variety of problems involving
  various norms, matrix inequalities, and other constraints. More
  information can be found in the <cite><a href=
  "cvx_usrguide.pdf"><tt>CVX</tt> Users' Guide</a>.</cite></p>

  <h3><a id="examples" name="examples">The example library</a></h3>

  <p>The <tt>CVX</tt> package includes a growing library of
  examples to help get you started. A large number of examples have
  been provided which reproduce figures or examples from the book
  <cite><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook">Convex
  Optimization</a>.</cite> We will continue to add to this library
  over time, particularly as new capabilities are added to
  <tt>CVX</tt>.</p>

  <p>You can browse through this library now&mdash;without having
  to download and install <tt>CVX</tt>&mdash;by <a href=
  "http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvx/examples/">clicking here</a>.
  Of course, if you wish to run any of the examples, please proceed
  to the <a href="#down">download section</a> below.</p>

  <h3><a id="system" name="system">System requirements</a></h3>

  <p>The <tt>CVX</tt> modeling system is built using <a href=
  "http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>, and
  requires version 6.1 or later of Matlab to run. It is built using
  both native Matlab code and C MEX files (as is SeDuMi).
  Precompiled binaries for Windows, Linux, and Solaris are supplied
  with the distribution, but it should work fine on other platforms
  as well, as long as they support both Matlab and SeDuMi. See
  Appendix A of the <a href="cvx_usrguide.pdf">user guide</a> for
  more detials, and for installation instructions.</p>

  list</a></h3>

  <h3><a id="hist" name="hist">Version history</a></h3>

  <dl>
    <dt>Version 0.80, July 2005:</dt>

    <dd>initial release.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.85, August 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Support for Matlab 6.1 and 6.5; previous versions required
    Matlab 7.0 or later.<br />
    Added precompiled binaries for Solaris.<br />
    Support for scalar quadratic forms (see Section 4.7 of the
    <a href="cvx_usrguide.pdf">user guide</a>).<br />
    Added the <tt>norms</tt> function to facilitate sum-of-norms
    and max-of-norms problems.<br />
    Various bug fixes incorporated.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.86, September 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Fixes for Matlab 6.1 compatability.</dd>

    <dd>Improved support for quadratic forms.</dd>

    <dd>A bug that prevented some Euclidean norm constraints from
    being declared was fixed.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.87/0.87.1, October 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Improved the setup routine (<tt>cvx_setup</tt>).</dd>

    <dd>Updated the documentation with a table of contents and a
    new section explaining the status messages returned by
    <tt>CVX</tt>.</dd>

    <dd>Implemented workarounds for bugs in SeDuMi's handling of
    certain degenerate problems.</dd>

    <dd>Created a MEX file to improve presolve performance.</dd>

    <dd>Miscellaneous bug fixes, performance improvements, and
    documentation updates.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.88, December 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Further improvements to the setup routine
    (<tt>cvx_setup</tt>).</dd>

    <dd>A bug with the potential to cause invalid numerical results
    has been fixed. It is unlikely that this bug has caused anyone
    problems, except for the person who reported it, because: 1) it
    required a unique set of circumstances to exercise it; and 2)
    even if it were exercised, it would likely produce
    <i>obviously</i> invalid results.</dd>

    <dd>Improvements have been made to prevent <tt>OUT OF
    MEMORY</tt> errors for certain large problems.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.89, December 2005:</dt>

    <dd>Official release of the expanded example library.</dd>

    <dd>Added support for indexed dual variables; see the
    documentation for details.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.90, January 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Added support for the geometric mean function
    <tt>geomean</tt> and the determinant function <tt>det_root2n</tt>,
    enabling the solution of determinant maximization problems. (Previous
    versions of <tt>cvx</tt> provided the <tt>geomean</tt> function,
    but it was not documented or supported because of its unreliability in infeasible
    problems. This shortcoming has been addressed, so now we have made it
    "official.")</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.91, January 2006:</dt>

    <dd>Added support for the determinant function <tt>det_rootn</tt>.</dd>
    <dd>Added a new semidefinite programming mode, which is activated
    with the command <tt>cvx_begin sdp</tt>; see the user guide
    for details.</dd>
    <dd>Miscellaneous bug fixes related to the solution of complex
    norm minimization problems, convex quadratic forms,
    and a workaround for a SeDuMi bug.</dd>

    <dt>Version 0.92, February 2006:</dt>

	<dd>Fixes for feasibility problems and large matrix multiplications
    <dd>Added support for the approximate <tt>log(sum(exp()))</tt> function
    <tt>logsumexp_sdp</tt>. This function allows geometric programs, already
    transformed into convex form, to be solved without the need for a
    dedicated solver: that is, SeDuMi will solve them! Type
    <tt>help logsumexp_sdp</tt> from the MATLAB command line for details.</dd>

  </dl>

  <h3><a id="plans" name="plans">Future plans</a></h3>

  <p>A major revision to <tt>cvx</tt> is in progress.
  This revision adds native support
  for generalized geometric programming and mixed convex/geometric
  programming. We had hoped to
  have it ready in January, but it has been delayed. However, it is now
  working well and we anticipate its release iminently; <i>i.e.</i>,
  in early March 2006.

  <p>The next major revision will add support for smooth nonlinearities.
  The current plan is
  to include <tt>log()</tt> and <tt>logdet()</tt>, <tt>exp()</tt>,
  <tt>entropy()</tt>, and convex and
  concave branches of <tt>pow(x,p)</tt>. Others may be added upon
  request. This revision will require the development of a new solver,
  however, so its release date cannot be predicted at this point.</p>
