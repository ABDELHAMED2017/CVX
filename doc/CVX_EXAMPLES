norm and penalty approximation (or least-norm) problems.
for fixed A,b, finds l_1, l_2, l_infty, huber, deadzone
solutions.  plots the residual distribution for each one.

min fuel optimal control.
minimize sum_t f(u(t))
s.t. x(t+1)=Ax(t)+Bu(t), given x(0), x(T)
f can be given as a simple PWL function (say)

min time optimal control.
linear dynamics, constraint set u(t) in U
(could be polyhedral)
x(0) given; final state is x(T)=0; want to minimize T.
use bisection to find min T.

placement problem. need to define cell
incidence matrix, locations of fixed cells.
could have simple quadratic version, also deadzone,
bounding box perimeter (maybe that is separate script)

separating hyperplane problems; SVM

minimal surface problems. variables are grid (matrix)
of z values on uniform x,y grid.
min, max, and interpolation values are given at various
points. plot surface in 3D.

FIR and IIR filter problems via spec fact.

control/Lyapunov problems

simple robust LP problem.  define robust LP; solve via SOCP.
do simple monte carlo analysis of robust and nonrobust
solutions.

simple portfolio optimization problem.
plot risk/return frontier.

simple robust LS problem.

simple l1/l2 problems (lasso).

simple portfolio worst-case variance problem, with
uncertain covariance matrix.  allow (some) short positions.

sparse approximation heuristic via l1.

nuclear norm function (not script)
(sum of singular values)
define using LMI

simple partitioning problem.
min x'Wx over x_i={-1,1}.
form eigenvector relaxation
also, form SDP relaxation.
could add simple local greedy function to improve
approximate solutions, and/or use a randomized method
