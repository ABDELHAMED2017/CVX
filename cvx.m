%CVX   The CVX disciplined convex programming system.
%   CVX is a modeling framework for building, constructing, and solving
%   disciplined convex programs. Typing the command
%       cvx_where
%   at the Matlab prompt will tell you precisely where the base directory
%   of cvx is located. In that directory, there is a subdirectory called
%   'doc', where you will find a quickstart guide that provides a full
%   description of CVX and how to use it.
